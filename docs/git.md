git stash:

**If you want to back up your changes**

git has an area called stash where you can temporarily store a snapshot of your changes without committing to the git repository.

Its separate from the working directory , the repository.

- you made some changes but you donâ€™t want to commit them and you want to switch to another branch-------

**GIT MERGE**

when the local branch is behind the master branch , the branch needs the new changes which are in master branch , then merge is used

Basically git merge creates a new commit with all the commits you made to the branch.

**GIT REBASE:**

when the local branch is behind the master branch , the branch needs the new changes which are in master branch , then fetch is used

Basically git rebase does not create a new commit , all the commits will be shown in the new branch , so unnecessary history.

**GIT FETCH:**

When we do git fetch all the changes from the repository will be downloaded into the remote directory/repository but not into local repository.

**GIT PULL -->** git fetch + git merge .

When we do git fetch all the changes from the repository will be downloaded into the remote directory/repository and then from remote local repository.
