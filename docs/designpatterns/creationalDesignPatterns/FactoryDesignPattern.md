**Intent**
----------
Define an interface for creating an object, but let subclasses decide which class to
instantiate. Factory Method lets a class defer instantiation to subclasses.

Also called  - *Virtual Constructor*

It promotes the loose-coupling by eliminating the need to bind application-specific classes into the code.
