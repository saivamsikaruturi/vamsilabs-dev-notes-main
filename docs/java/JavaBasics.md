## Java Basics

**High Level Language:** Man can understand these languages C++,Java

**Low Level Language:** Machine only can understand

1.Assembly level Language (Mnemonics)

2.Machine level Language(0’s and 1’s)

Java is Platform Independent

JVM is Platform Dependent

JDK=JRE+DEV Tools

JRE=JVM+ Library classes

JIT


## What Is the JVM?

A Virtual Machine is a software implementation of a physical machine.
Java was developed with the concept of WORA (Write Once Run Anywhere), which runs on a VM.
The compiler compiles the Java file into a Java .class file, then that .class file is input into the JVM, which loads and executes the class file.
Below is a diagram of the Architecture of the JVM.

How Does the JVM Work?
As shown in the above architecture diagram, the JVM is divided into three main subsystems:

ClassLoader Subsystem
Runtime Data Area
Execution Engine
1. ClassLoader Subsystem
   Java's dynamic class loading functionality is handled by the ClassLoader subsystem. It loads, links. and initializes the class file when it refers to a class for the first time at runtime, not compile time.

1.1 Loading
Classes will be loaded by this component. BootStrap ClassLoader, Extension ClassLoader, and Application ClassLoader are the three ClassLoaders that will help in achieving it.

BootStrap ClassLoader – Responsible for loading classes from the bootstrap classpath, nothing but rt.jar. Highest priority will be given to this loader.
Extension ClassLoader – Responsible for loading classes which are inside the ext folder (jre\lib).
Application ClassLoader –Responsible for loading Application Level Classpath, path mentioned Environment Variable, etc.
The above ClassLoaders will follow Delegation Hierarchy Algorithm while loading the class files.

1.2 Linking
Verify – Bytecode verifier will verify whether the generated bytecode is proper or not if verification fails we will get the verification error.
Prepare – For all static variables memory will be allocated and assigned with default values.
Resolve – All symbolic memory references are replaced with the original references from Method Area.
1.3 Initialization
This is the final phase of ClassLoading; here, all static variables will be assigned with the original values, and the static block will be executed.
